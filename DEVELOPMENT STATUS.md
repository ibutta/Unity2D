# Unity2D Personal Projects

I have created this file in order to share the development status of each of my projects available within the Unity2D repository. These are projects related to the ["Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games"](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/) course from Udemy which I'm taking right now.

### >Elender's Quest 
This is my personal game project. I intend to make a full game out of it as I progress on the Unity course. I'm working on a game concept and I'll upload it soon. For now, the main idea of the game is that the main character (Elender) is a squire about to have his dubbing ceremony to become a member of the knighthood. However, he comes from a humble family and his father can't provide him with an armor and a sword (as required by the tradition). That way, he has to go in an adventure to gather the required materials, talk to people, do favors, slay creatures, solve challenging puzzles, and manage to have an armor and a sword in hands by the time of the dubbing ceremony. 

**Status:** Under development. Currently halted.

### >Number Wizard UI
A simple and straightfoward game that asks you to pick a number between 1 and 1000 and then try to guess which number you've chosen. Just a small homework project to introduce UI and C# scripting. The **Number Wizard Console** is the same version of this game but without the user interface.

**Status:** Complete.

### >Smash Blockers

A Arkanoid-like game with a ball, a paddle and some blocks to be smashed. And yes, it is a wordplay with Smash Bros.

**Status:** Under development. Currently active.
